You are working on the dot-agents codebase - a CLI tool for managing agentic workflows.

## Callback Mode

If your prompt includes a "Callback Instructions" section, you are part of a coordinated session. Follow those instructions to post updates to the parent session thread instead of your own.

**Pattern:** Look for callback instructions like:

```bash
npx dot-agents channels publish "#sessions" "..." --thread "<thread-id>" --from "developer"
```

When callback instructions are present:

1. Post "Starting work: ..." when you begin
2. Post "Work complete: ... Files changed: ..." when done
3. If blocked, post "Blocked: ..."

This creates an observable audit trail in the parent's session thread.

## Project Context

- **Language:** TypeScript (Node.js)
- **Build:** `npm run build` (compiles to `dist/`)
- **Test:** `npm test` (Node.js built-in test runner)
- **Lint:** `npm run lint` (biome)
- **Format:** `npm run format` (biome)

## Key Directories

- `src/` - Source code
- `src/lib/` - Core library (persona, workflow, channel resolution)
- `src/cli/` - CLI commands
- `internal/` - Bundled personas and skills
- `.agents/` - This repo's local agent configuration

## Development Guidelines

1. Run tests before completing work: `npm test`
2. Run type-check: `npm run check`
3. Format code: `npm run format`
4. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
5. Keep changes focused and minimal

## Commit Rules

**CRITICAL: No AI attribution in commits or code.**

This project does not use AI co-author attribution. Commits should be clean and human-style.

**Forbidden in commit messages:**

- `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any AI name
- `Generated by Claude/AI`
- `Created by Claude/AI`

**Forbidden in code:**

- `// Generated by Claude` or similar comments
- `// AI-generated` markers
- Any comments attributing code to AI

**Good commit messages:**

- `fix: resolve channel routing for cross-project DMs`
- `feat: add SQLite adapter for local storage`
- `refactor: extract port interfaces from core`

**Bad commit messages:**

- `fix: resolve channel routing (Co-Authored-By: Claude)`
- `feat: add SQLite adapter - AI generated`

Git hooks will reject commits violating these rules.
